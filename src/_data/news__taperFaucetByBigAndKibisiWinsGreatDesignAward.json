    "content": "The Taper Faucet from our KiBiSi collaboration has been awarded Architectural Digestâ€™s inaugural Great Design Award. The award is presented to a curated selection of products, distinctively chosen to appeal to tastemakers, influencers and design enthusiasts. Taper reinvents minimalist design through shape-shifting geometry, turning the practical into poetry. The inviting contours of Taper reach forward, transforming cone to cylinder into a distinctive right angle that eliminates the escutcheon and turn-down tip. The result is a design that is unconventional, unexpected and playfully approachable.",
