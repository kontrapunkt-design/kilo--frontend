    "content": "Bend is a bendy hybrid between a static symmetrical table lamp and a flexible work lamp, resulting in a product that combines the long-lived tradition of interior lighting with the uncompromisingly functionalist character of classic, industrial desk lamps. The cast base supports a centred gooseneck tube, allowing the head to bend freely in all directions, while an integrated grip at the top of the lampshade prompts intuitive aiming of the light. The surface touch function at the base turns the lamp on and off and dims the light. BEND combines design-historical references with the use of modern LED technology in a contemporary, convenient and versatile light source fit for home, office and hotel settings.",
